<h1>Differnce between Java and Java Script</h1>
<p>I have often wondered why java and javascript share roughly the same name but, pretty much nothing else. From 
    the article that I have read both Java and Javascript were some of the first programming languages out there to really gain traction.
    Javascript began as with the code name "Mocha" but, then launched as Livescript which was origonally written by one guy, named Brendan Eich,
     in 10 days to assist with user interaction during the beginning of the internet.
    Java on the other hand was made more for the application as well as with a more corperate feel to its development.
     Its creation happend through a team from Sun Microsystems
    called the green team in 1991. The only real similatiry these two have in thier creation was by force when a company 
    called Netscape saw Java growing in popularity and just decided to
    change Livescripts name for the sole reason of apparances since Java was becomming so popular and Livescript wasn't a very attractive name.
