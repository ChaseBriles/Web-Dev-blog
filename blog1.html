<h1>Differnce between Java and Java Script</h1>
<p>I have often wondered why Java and Javascript share roughly the same name but, pretty much nothing else. From 
    the article that I have read both Java and Javascript were some of the first programming languages out there to really gain traction.
    Javascript began as with the code name "Mocha" but, then launched as Livescript which was origonally written by one guy, named Brendan Eich,
     in 10 days to assist with user interaction during the beginning of the internet.
    Java on the other hand was made more for the application as well as with a more corperate feel to its development.
     Its creation happend through a team from Sun Microsystems
    called the green team in 1991. The only real similatiry these two have in thier creation was by force when a company 
    called Netscape saw Java growing in popularity and just decided to
    change Livescripts name for the sole reason of apparances since Java was becomming so popular and Livescript wasn't a very attractive name.
    This answered my question about why they share the same name and honestly I thought it would be a lot deeper than some company just wanting to
    make thier brand name more appealing. But, this made me even more curious about exactly how differnt they were so I read on looking at how differnt they actually were.

   It is apparent that Java and Javascript have from the very start drastically differnt fundemantal uses. 
   Right off the bat I knew that Java was an Object Orinted programming Languages but, Javascript on the other hand is a Object Oriented Scripting language 
   which are completely differnt ways to programming which to so suprise made them even more differnt from eachother. Further more
   Javascript is used more for web based interfaces and other user interaction capabilites. 
   While Java is more commonly seen in an application format such a mobile apps and a multitude of other applications for the language. When it comes to actually writing and compiling they grow even more diffenent,
   Java is one of many languages that requires it to be compiled after writing it to see what actually happens, while Javascript code is all-text which falls more in line with
   how HTML is written making the divide between them even larger. Going even deeper to thier uses Javascript can only be ran in a browser which astounded me since it is such a popular language and Java can be
   in both a virtual machine or a browers!

    At the end of looking at them I decided to see if even thier "hello World" programs were just as differnt as everything else about them and to no surpise they abolutly were.

<h2>Hello Worlds Collide</h2>
<p>Java Scirpt Hello World<br> console.log("hello world!")</p>
<p>Java Hello World<br> System.out.print("hello world")</p>
