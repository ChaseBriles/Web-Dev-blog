<h1>Javascript Animation</h1>
<p>For this weeks blog I wanted to play around with java script specifically what animations were possible. Css animations were very barebones and a bit tricky to work with. Looking 
    at java script animations it is more like the functional and object oriented coding we have done before than what what CSS is like. I decided to do a simple one just to get a better
    feel for what the animations were like. I decided to make a few methods to move an object, in this case a picture around the screen. The biggest key to this animation is creating an 
    object that is moveable in this case it is created as a var called imgObj and set to null at the start of the script.
</p>

<p>
    The true way that this animation works is by java scripts way of munipulating an object in this case a picture as we have already said before. Javascript allows for somethings location
    on screen to be changed by obtaining the objects location using a parse int method that is already in the base library. Next we tell the object how much we want it to move per pixels on the screen.
    We also set a Timeout for each of the movement functions so that there is a little bit of time before they start. Inorder to actually stop this animation you can set it to stop after a while
    but, in this case we created a stop function that clears the timeout already given to the image. We can also reset the pictures location by just putting a certain pixel value to the .left
    attribute in the object.

    <pre>
    var imgObj = null;
    var animate ;
    
    function init() {
       imgObj = document.getElementById('myImage');
       imgObj.style.position= 'relative'; 
       imgObj.style.left = '500px'; 
    }
    function moveRight() {
       imgObj.style.left = parseInt(imgObj.style.left) + 10 + 'px';
       animate = setTimeout(moveRight,20);    // call moveRight in 20msec
    }

    function moveLeft() {
       imgObj.style.left = parseInt(imgObj.style.left) - 10 + 'px';
       animate = setTimeout(moveLeft,20);    // call moveRight in 20msec
    }

    function stop() {
       clearTimeout(animate);
       imgObj.style.left = '500px'; 
    }
    
    window.onload = init;
    </pre>

    <img id = "myImage" src = "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/11/01/20/41/firetruck-1789560__340.pngf" width="20%">
    <p>Click the buttons below to handle animation</p>
    <input type = "button" value = "Move Right" onclick = "moveRight();" />
    <input type = "button" value = "Move Left" onclick = "moveLeft();" />
    <input type = "button" value = "Stop" onclick = "stop();" />
</form>
