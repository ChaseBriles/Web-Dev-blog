<h1>Final Blog Post</h1>
<p>
    If I was teaching CS 347 in the spring, I would keep much of the class the same. I would keep the labs that we have done in class along with the similar format of 
    the labs being done in class so there is help there for explinations. I would keep the text book since it turned out to be extremly handy during project situations
    where the code could get a little abstract and confusing since alot of us were not used to this type of programming. I would however, put in a little bit more of a lecture element to the class
    i felt the mudy point were a bit helpful but, never really stressed key ideas that we should have been reallying focusing on. I know the text book talks about them but, reenforcent of
    these key concepts would help students understand and rember it better. I would tone down some of the labs since some really felt like alot to do in just a class period and could get a 
    bit muddled with other idea and concepts that werent really a key part of that days lecture.
